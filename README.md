# Basil
Your In Store Shopping Assistant.

Yesterday I walked into Whole Foods - there is fresh basil on sale. The deal looks good but I have never really used Basil before. I am tempted to buy it but there questions in my mind - how do I used it, how to cut it, best way to store it ?

I am at crossroads but its difficult to find someone immediately to ask my questions.

Basil is your shopping assistant that helps solve this problem. Customers are already in store and ready to pruchase, with Basil they can make informed decision

The App uses vision APIs to recognize items and display relevant curated information to make an informed decision.
