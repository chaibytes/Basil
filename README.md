# Basil
Your In Store Grocery Shopping Assistant.

You walk into Whole Foods - there is fresh basil on sale. I have never really used Basil before and I am tempted to buy it. But the questions in my mind go through - how do i used it, how to store

At that point its difficult to find someone imeediately to ask questions.

Basil is your grocery shopping assistant that helps solve this problem. Customers are already in store and ready to pruchase, with Basil they can make informed decision

The App uses vision APIs to recognize items and display relevant curated information to make an informed decision.

This concept is not only for Grocery stores but can extended to any retail stores that wants to increase purchases by empowering users with better knowledge.
